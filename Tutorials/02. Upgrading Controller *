Upgrading Controller


This tutorial talks about a key strategic object in your room: 
  Room Controller.
By controlling this invincible structure you can build facilities in the room. 
  The higher the controller level, the more structures are available to be built.



1. Create new worker creep to upgrade controller level: 'Upgrader1'
    Game.spawns['Spawn1'].spawnCreep( [WORK, CARRY, MOVE], 'Upgrader1' );
    
Documentation:
  Control
  Game.spawns
  StructureSpawn.spawnCreep



2. Memory - We can write custom information into the creeps "memory" by utilizing the memory property of the creep in the Memory tab of the console window.
    role='harvester' in memory of harvester creeps
      Game.creeps['Harvester1'].memory.role = 'harvester';
    role='upgrader' in memory of upgrader creeps
      Game.creeps['Upgrader1'].memory.role = 'upgrader';

Documentation:
  Memory object
  Creep.memory



3. You can check your creeps' memory in either the creep info panel on the left or the "Memory" tab on the console window

Let's define the behavior of hte new creep: 
  both types of creeps should harvest energy, harvester should bring to spawn, upgrader should go to Controller and apply 'upgradeController' to the Controller
    Get Controller object with 'Creep.room.controller' property

Create new module 'role.upgrader' with behavior logic of new creep:

var roleUpgrader = {

    /** @param {Creep} creep **/
    run: function(creep) {
	    if(creep.carry.energy == 0) {
            var sources = creep.room.find(FIND_SOURCES);
            if(creep.harvest(sources[0]) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                creep.moveTo(sources[0]);
            }
        }
        else {
            if(creep.upgradeController(creep.room.controller) == ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE) {
                creep.moveTo(creep.room.controller);
            }
        }
	}
};

module.exports = roleUpgrader;
     
Documentation:
  RoomObject.room
  Room.controller
  Creep.upgradeController



4. In main module, all creeps run the same role. Need to divide behavior depending on previously defined property 'Creep.memory.role' by connecting new module.

var roleHarvester = require('role.harvester');
var roleUpgrader = require('role.upgrader');

module.exports.loop = function () {

    for(var name in Game.creeps) {
        var creep = Game.creeps[name];
        if(creep.memory.role == 'harvester') {
            roleHarvester.run(creep);
        }
        if(creep.memory.role == 'upgrader') {
            roleUpgrader.run(creep);
        }
    }
}
